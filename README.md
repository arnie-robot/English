# English

English is a PHP library for tokenising English text strings into their constituent parts.

This is a fork of NinjaPOST, which neatens the code up to the point of usability.

## History

This code is based on the GPosTTL library by Golam Mortuza Hossain, which is in turn based on Brill's rule-based Parts-Of-Speech Tagger.

## License

Looking at the previous licenses, they all seem versions of the MIT license. Hence this code is released under the MIT license for ease of use and future-compatibility.

The original code is copyright MIT; changes copyright Chris Alexander. See the LICENSE file for more information.
